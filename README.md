RAG System with FAISS for Vector Search
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using FAISS as a vector database for efficient similarity search. The system retrieves relevant text chunks based on user queries and integrates them into a language model response.

Features
Vector Database: Uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient nearest neighbor search.

Embeddings: Utilizes Ollama to generate embeddings from text.


Technologies Used
